# freshdesk-ticket-assigner

Automatically assign tickets to Freshdesk agents.

This is a way to prevent paying for the [Automatic ticket assignment -feature](https://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/196581-understanding-automatic-ticket-assignment) which comes only in Forest or above plans, and
Forst costs extra 20â‚¬/mo/agent compared to the Garden plan.
